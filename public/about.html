<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p> <b>Hi, I'm Eric John Dailisan</b>, a 25-year-old driven by creativity, technology, and personal growth.<br>
  I'm a huge anime enthusiast, with One Piece, Shokugeki no Soma, and Bungo Stray Dogs being my all-time favorites.<br> 
  These shows fuel my imagination, pushing me to explore different perspectives and characters.<br>
   My love for anime also influences one of my other passionsâ€”making portraits. I enjoy translating<br>
   the inspiration I get from these stories into visual art, giving me a creative outlet to express the<br>
   emotions and themes that resonate with me.</p>

  <p>Aside from my creative interests, I'm actively pursuing a career in technology.<br> 
    My goal is to become a full-stack web developer, building dynamic, user-friendly<br> 
    websites and applications. I'm constantly learning and honing my skills to achieve this,<br> 
    because being successful in this field is one of my biggest aspirations. But I also believe<br> 
    in balance. To stay active, I love playing basketball, a sport that lets me challenge myself<br> 
    both mentally and physically. And when it's time to recharge, you'll find me indulging in<br> 
    my favorite pastime: sleeping. Whether I'm immersed in anime, coding, or sports, I strive to<br>
    grow, improve, and find fulfillment in every aspect of life.</p>
